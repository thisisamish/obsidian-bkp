Watching it on YT. 20 minutes into the movie and I notice one peculiar thing. The actors - it feels like they're acting, like it's a stage drama. There's scenes and then there's a transition into other scene. But that transition is just a slideshow transition, not some storytelling method. That's why some of the scenes feel very jarring. Dialogues and characters' emotions change so quickly and that is accompanied by a loud, thundering bg score. The score isn't always there but when it is, it's very annoying. I have seen the movie until this point before and I kinda feel bored? Like I get that it's a classic movie but maybe because of the "acting" acting and just the fact that this movie is extremely old and it has some Bollywood tropes (that maa character is so "Bollywood maa"), I feel very disconnected. The reason might also be that for few weeks now, I can't really focus on movies, or even tv shows for that matter. I don't do anything particular on weekend but I still don't really get the urge to watch a movie. That is why I am gonna stop the movie here again. I'll come back to it tomorrow, hopefully.
