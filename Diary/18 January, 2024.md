I'm in Sultanpur. Came here on 16th and I was supposed to go back to my home today and then back to Noida tomorrow. Plan changed. Papa said I should go back on 20th. I also wanted to stay a day more here in Sultanpur. So I'm staying today. Booked the bus ticket for 20th. Train was almost 12 hours late yesterday so that's not an option today.
It's funny how I want to write so much but when I sit down to write, I get confused as to where to actually start from. Should I give you the background story or should I just start writing about the current feelings? Which feeling should I start from? Because there are many. Will I be able to finish this entry or will I, again, have to end it in the middle?
I guess I can try to list as many things as possible and then we can take them one by one. That sounds like a good idea. I'll probably won't be able to finish talking about all of them but hey, a boy can try, right? So here are the things I want to talk about:
1. The slump in applying to opportunities. In extension, the outdated resume, the gap in LeetCode profile, GitHub profile, the abysmal projects, no experience, the lack of motivation.
2. Discontentment in the current salary.
3. Finding someone to love. And will he like me? Will Suraj like me? Is he just there because he feels stuck since he messaged me earlier and now I've hung onto him like a lice on a head?
4. Aspirations for a room of my own, new phone, content creation, becoming smarter, getting a better body.
5. Not being able to give mom and dad a reason to be proud, and not being able to help mom and dad financially. I want to be in a position where mom asks for something and I just order it for her.
6. Figuring out how to navigate being gay? Who else should I tell? Am I obliged to tell everyone? Will they care? How and when will I tell didis and papa and mummy and badi mummy and bade papa and everyone? Will bade papa never talk to me? Worse, will didis understand?
7. Will I make something out of myself?
8. Will I ever feel confident about me? I have to find a hairstyle that's manageable and looks good. How do I find it?
9. What do I truly need to be content? What will it take to reach that contentment? Will that contentment be enough?
Hmm... I guess that's it? Maybe I'll remember some more topics later and then I'll add them above. Now, let's go from the back and tackle number 9.
I guess here are the things that I feel will make me pretty happy if not totally content:
1. A phone: Samsung Galaxy or iPhone 15.
2. A boy, someone who's understanding and cute and truly wants to be in a relationship.
3. A room of my own that looks good. No more C2-46 19th century walls and floor.
4. A decent salary: 45k is good.
5. Help dad with the washroom, financially. And get mom a geyser.
6. Some new clothes. Trendy ones, and formal ones. I must look good.
Writing all this is making me feel motivated to study. Should I leave it all here and go study? Oh wait I got to finish that book - I Came Upon A Lighthouse. And then I have to study Micro Systems. And Machine Learning. And Personal Projects.
See? So many things. All at once. I want to do so much and I never know what to focus on. Actually wait, I do. And also, I have to study Java and SQL for Newgen. Okay this is enough. We'll talk more about feeling some other day. Going to do today's LeetCode and then we'll talk. Maybe some other day. Bye!
